# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a web-based sorting visualizer implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to visualize and better understand how these algorithms work.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes implementations and visualizations of the following sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
  - **Heap Sort**
  - **Radix Sort** (optional, if implemented)
  - **Shell Sort** (optional, if implemented)
  - **Counting Sort** (optional, if implemented)

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Displays each step of the sorting process with animations to illustrate the algorithm's behavior.
- **Array Size Adjustment**: Users can customize the size of the array to be sorted, from small arrays for quick visualizations to larger arrays for more in-depth study.
- **Speed Control**: Offers control over the speed of the visualization, enabling users to observe sorting algorithms at different speeds.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
